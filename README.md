# Project: Implementing and Solving the Rubik's Cube

## Preamble & Objective

The Rubik's Cube, a creation of Erno Rubik, a Hungarian architect and sculptor, made its debut in 1974. Its journey from a local toy store item in Hungary in 1977 to a worldwide sensation by 1980 marks a remarkable trajectory in puzzle history. Within two years, from 1980 to 1982, over a hundred million Rubik's Cubes were sold, eventually earning it the title of the perfect puzzle. To date, more than two hundred million units have been sold.

Beyond the competitive realm where enthusiasts strive to solve it in record times, the Rubik's Cube presents a fascinating optimization challenge for mathematicians. The sheer number of potential configurations makes finding a solution by random attempts impractical, thus giving rise to various solving algorithms.

In this project, we aim to delve into one of the simplest resolution algorithms by undertaking the following two key steps:

1. **Implementation of the Rubik's Cube:** Detail the process of creating a virtual model of the Rubik's Cube, capturing its structure and the essence of its complexity.

2. **Exploration of a Simple Solving Algorithm:** Introduce and explain a straightforward algorithm for solving the Rubik's Cube, demonstrating its application on the implemented model.

This project not only seeks to celebrate the enduring legacy of the Rubik's Cube but also aims to provide an insightful exploration into the mathematical and computational techniques used in its resolution.
